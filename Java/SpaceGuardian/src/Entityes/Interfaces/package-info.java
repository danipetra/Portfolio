/*
the interfaces allow to get the difference between Enemies and Player and bullets, so 
you can detect the collisions only of the arraylists of the elements that are enemy or friendly entities.
doing so the collision detector needs only two methods to confront the objects and not 
one for each tipe of enemy(or other objects).
